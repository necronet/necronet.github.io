After 4+ amazing years, my time at Automattic came to an unexpected end as part of a recent layoff. It’s been a week of reflection, gratitude, and looking forward. I’m proud of the work I did, thankful for the support I've received, and ready for what’s next—whether it’s running a 21k, brushing up on cloud skills, or finding that next role where I can grow and make an impact.

## And just like that ... it's over

So now it's friday I have already cool off a bit into what happened last week on April 2nd, I was taken out by the way of layoff and  [in the blink of a second stop being part of Automattic](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/wordpress-maker-automattic-lays-off-16-of-staff/), I'm very proud of the work I did for the last 4+ years; so there's not much else to say about it really, I have already made my peace with it, and I'm finally able to sit down, write about it, acknowledge it and move on. I'm very thanksful for the friends and colleagues that reached out to me and keep actively supporting me so let's see what the future brings up next!.

In the meantime of looking for job I also have a bunch of things in my bucket list:

- Read a bunch book, that have been judging me for over 6 months now!
- Continue to get ready for 21k run on May. Yes I know [therapy is also an option](https://www.instagram.com/thegistca/p/DB84BvbPNR8/?img_index=3).
- Brush up on cloud skills and learning new ones including containarizatoin, IaC, kubernetes and so on.
- Learn a trait, I'm pretty sure that will come handy in the future where the robots takeover!

Speaking of which, I'm actively looking for a position which I can contribute and continue to grow! Until next one
